### Project introduction 
Understanding and accurately identifying emotions from text tweets presents challenges due to the inherent complexity of human expression in written form. Ambiguities in language, including sarcasm, irony, and slang, present difficulties in correctly deciphering the underlying sentiment. In addition, cultural and contextual nuances further complicate the process, which can lead to misinterpretations. Moreover, the subjective nature of emotions and the lack of explicit indicators often hinder the development of robust and universally applicable models of emotion recognition
